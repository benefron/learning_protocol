# Learning on MEA
This repository holds the functions and protocol to run an experiment based on the work of *Shahaf and Marom 2001* testing the network activity of a neuronal culture on an MEA undergoing a stimulation protocol for uninstructed learning 

## Outline of experiment
- Monitoring ongoing activity on the entire chip
- Running a stimulation protocol to identify target electrode
